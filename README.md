Custom Jain-inspired Alexa Skill

### Jai Jinendra
This is a greeting [Jains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism) use to greet each other. This custom Alexa skill adds that ability to Alexa. It also offers a spiritual quote after greeting.
These quotes have been scraped from [@SadguruWhispers](https://twitter.com/SadguruWhispers), which is now a dormant account. Hence, there is no reason to run the scraper anymore.
The twitter tools are found in [tweetscraper](https://github.com/vishwa35/jainalexa/tree/master/tweetscraper) and the alexa skill under [jainalexa](https://github.com/vishwa35/jainalexa/tree/master/jainalexa).

Thanks to my dad for inspiration on creating the skill and my mom for the quote source.

This skill was written using the Flask-Ask Python wrapper for Alexa Skills, and deployed using [Zappa](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa) as a Lambda function.
